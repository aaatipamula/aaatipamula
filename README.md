# About Me
I am a computer science student at the University of Kansas with interest in cyber security, backend frameworks, networking and databases. I have a passion for most things tech and am usually working on a new project, or trying to improve an old one!

Most of coding experience has been in Python, but I have worked with JavaScript and TypeScript on a few projects.

I also love custom mechanical keyboards, check out [the butterfly](https://github.com/aaatipamula/butterfly) a keyboard I designed!
